# LinkNayan

> **WORK IN PROGRESS** - This project is currently under active development as part of my AI learning journey.

**Your bridge to mental health support in the Philippines**

---

## What is this?

LinkNayan is an AI-powered CLI tool I'm building to help Filipinos find mental health resources. Instead of Googling and getting overwhelmed, users can describe their situation in plain language and get matched with appropriate resources like crisis hotlines, therapists, and support groups.

"LinkNayan" = "Link" + "Nayan" (Tagalog for "ours")

---

## Important Disclaimer

This is **NOT** medical advice or a replacement for professional help. It's an information tool to help people find resources. Always consult mental health professionals for actual treatment.

**Crisis?** Call **NCMH: 0917-899-8727** or **Emergency: 911**

---

## Current Status

**Phase:** Building core features (Active development)

**What works:**
- Project setup with UV
- OpenRouter AI integration (config.py done)
- Resource database structure (hotlines, professionals, resources JSON files)
- Resource loader (resources.py done)

**In progress:**
- Crisis detection (ai.py)
- Situation analysis (ai.py)

**Not started yet:**
- CLI interface (main.py)
- Web app (Streamlit)

Honest note: Progress has been slow — this is a solo project built while studying full-time as a first-year CS student. Building it properly matters more than building it fast.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **UV** - Fast package manager (replaces pip/venv)
- **OpenRouter** - Free AI models (GPT-OSS 120B)
- **OpenAI SDK** - API integration

---

## Installation (for testing)

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11+
- UV package manager

## What I'm Learning

This is my first AI project as a first-year CS student. Through this I'm learning:

- Working with AI APIs (OpenRouter)
- Modern Python tooling (UV)
- JSON data management
- Python project structure
- Prompt engineering
- Building ethical AI (crisis detection, safety)
- CLI design and user experience

---

## Goals

**Immediate (this week):**
- Finish ai.py (detect_crisis, analyze_situation)
- Build main.py (CLI interface)
- Get working end-to-end prototype

**Short-term:**
- Convert CLI to Streamlit web app
- Deploy to public URL
- User testing with 5-10 people

**Long-term:**
- Tagalog language support
- Location-based filtering
- Messenger bot integration
- Partnership with mental health orgs

---
